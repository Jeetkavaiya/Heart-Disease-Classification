# Heart-Disease-Classification
<br/>
This is a complete Heart Disease Classification Project using Machine learning.
<br/>
1️⃣ Data Collection & Preprocessing: The original data came from the Cleavland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

<br/>
2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigated correlations and patterns within the dataset to guide feature selection and model design.
<br/>
3️⃣ Feature Engineering: Engineered relevant features like age, cp levels, and exercise habits to enhance model performance.
<br/>
4️⃣ Model Selection: Explored various algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbours classifier to find the best fit for the data.
<br/>
5️⃣ Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized model parameters using techniques like Grid Search to maximize accuracy and robustness.
<br/>
6️⃣ Evaluation & Validation: Assessed models using metrics such as ROC curve and AUC score, Confusion matrix, Classification report, Precision, Recall, and F1-score to ensure reliability and effectiveness.
